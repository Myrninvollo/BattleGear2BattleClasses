Battlegear 2 ItemStats
======================

**Note:** "Dual Bonus" refers to a bonus that will be applied when wielding 2 of the same type of weapon. All dual bonus's are currently not implemented. 

Waraxe
------

* **Wood Waraxe**
	* *Damage:* 3
	* *Max Uses:* 59
	* *Ignore Damage Amount:* 1
* **Stone Waraxe**
	* *Damage:* 4
	* *Max Uses:* 131
	* *Ignore Damage Amount:* 1
* **Iron Waraxe**
	* *Damage:* 5
	* *Max Uses:* 250
	* *Ignore Damage Amount:* 1
* **Diamond Waraxe**
	* *Damage:* 6
	* *Max Uses:* 1564
	* *Ignore Damage Amount:* 1
* **Gold Waraxe**
	* *Damage:* 3
	* *Max Uses:* 32
	* *Ignore Damage Amount:* 2
**Dual bonus** Possibly increase "damage" by 1 (bringing it in line with the sword)

**Notes:** Damage is calculated by the normal damage from a sword - 1. The ignore damage value will not have it's damage mitigated by armour, maening the waraxe will be more effective against armoured enemies.

Mace (not implemented)
----------------------
* **Wood Mace**
	* *Damage:* 3
	* *Max Uses:* 59
	* *Daze Chance:* 5%
* **Stone Mace**
	* *Damage:* 4
	* *Max Uses:* 131
	* *Daze Chance:* 10%
* **Iron Mace**
	* *Damage:* 5
	* *Max Uses:* 250
	* *Daze Chance:* 15%
* **Diamond Mace**
	* *Damage:* 6
	* *Max Uses:* 1564
	* *Daze Chance:* 20%
* **Gold Mace**
	* *Damage:* 3
	* *Max Uses:* 32
	* *Daze Chance:* 25%
**Dual bonus**: maybe incrase daze chance or duration

**Notes:** Stuns could easily be implemented by applying a confusion, weakness and slowdown potion. We could also make it so when a player or NPC is hit when under the effects of these 3 potions they are removed. This will likely make the mace less effective than the old battlegear mace, but the changes may be required for propper pvp balance. I would think a 3 second stun should be enough


Dagger
------
* **Wood Dagger**
	* *Damage:* 2
	* *Max Uses:* 59
* **Stone Dagger**
	* *Damage:* 3
	* *Max Uses:* 131
* **Iron Dagger**
	* *Damage:* 4
	* *Max Uses:* 250
* **Diamond Dagger**
	* *Damage:* 5
	* *Max Uses:* 1564
* **Gold Dagger**
	* *Damage:* 2
	* *Max Uses:* 32
**Dual Bonus:**: Really not sure about this one? Maybe this can be the "backstab" feature?

**Notes:** The dagger will also ignore part of the hitshield, currently it halves the normal hitshield. We may also implement some sort of "sneak" damage?

Spear

	* *Damage:* 2
	* *Max Uses:* 59
	* *charge/mount damage*: 5
	* *Reach: *5
